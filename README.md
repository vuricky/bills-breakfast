# Bill's Breakfast

A full stack web application

Prompt: Bill's Breakfast needs an application to keep track of customers, items, and orders.
Actions: User can add/edit customer informatiom, can add/edit items, and view orders. Users can
also add items to their cart, view a subtotal, then select a customer to check out for. If a customer's
name is not present, the user can go and add a new customer, same idea with an item. 

The project was created through the I-211 - Information Infrastructure II (Indiana University) where I was tasked to create
a full stack web application after learning about concepts such as the following
- UNIX based envrionments
- Front end development; HTML, CSS, mainly used bootstrap, and jinjaa
- Back end - flask, database management (MySql), routes, and templates
